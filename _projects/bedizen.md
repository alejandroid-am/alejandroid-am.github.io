## The Value Proposition
BEDiZEN is a B2B startup with a clear mission: democratize WebXR. Augmented Reality shouldn't be a luxury for big brands. We wanted to offer SMBs (Small and Medium Businesses) a way to showcase their products in 3D without needing a custom app.

## The Challenge: Technical Constraints
As both the designer and frontend developer, I had to make decisions that balanced aesthetics with performance. 
* **The Tech Stack:** We needed a commercial-ready stack. I had to research WebGL libraries to find the right balance between visual fidelity and load times.
* **IP Protection:** A major concern was protecting the 3D models we created from being easily stolen or downloaded by competitors.

## The Execution (v1 vs v2)
I prototyped the entire platform in Figma and then built it.

* **The "Brutalist" Approach:** I chose a raw, simple aesthetic. It wasn't a stylistic choice—it was a usability one. The interface needed to be incredibly readable for non-tech clients who find AR intimidating.
* **Evolution to Tailwind:** * *Version 1:* Built with vanilla HTML/CSS.
    * *Version 2:* I refactored the frontend using **Tailwind CSS**. This allowed me to iterate faster and create a much cleaner tab system for the user dashboard, improving the UX significantly.
