## The Context & The Pain
Construction sites are chaotic. The site manager was receiving a decentralized mess of information: photos sent via WhatsApp, emails with vague subjects, and loose text messages. 

Tracking the progress of a specific site became a nightmare of digging through chat logs. It took too much time and effort to simply answer the question: *"Is the job done?"*

## The Insight: "Dirty Hands" UX
During the research phase, I realized a crucial constraint: **The end-users are not tech-savvy.** Construction workers have dirty hands, wear gloves, and work under bright sunlight. They don't have the patience to navigate complex menus. The app needed to be invisible. The flow had to be linear and instantaneous.

## The Solution: Open > Shoot > Done
I designed an interface based on **radical simplification**.

1.  **Zero Data Entry:** We removed the need to type. Location, time, and date are automatically captured by the backend (developed by the dev team).
2.  **High Contrast UI:** I created a "High Brightness Mode" UI with massive buttons and strong contrast to ensure visibility under direct sunlight.
3.  **The Flow:** The user opens the app, the camera is already active, they take the shot, and it syncs. That's it.

### Visual Identity
To support the product, I developed a mini brand style guide. I chose a palette of 4 high-visibility colors inspired by safety gear and proposed 3 logo variations that convey stability and speed.
