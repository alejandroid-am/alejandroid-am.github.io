              Am I the right person for your project? 
              <br>
              Let’s find out...
              <br><br>
              Adaptability, isn't something I learned in a tutorial; it’s my competitive advantage.
              <br><br>
                At 23, I left Cuba to become an entrepreneur in Chile, where I co-founded Somos Arte Ltda. and built a community of over 10,000 followers from scratch. At 30, I reset my life for love by crossing the ocean to France, mastering a third language along the way.
              <br><br>
                I come from a culture where resourcefulness is a daily reality. This mindset, combined with my real-world business experience, allows me to design interfaces that are not just aesthetic, but functional and profitable.
              <br><br>
              Today, I channel that determination into creating immersive, interactive experiences and platforms for SMBs like BEDiZEN. I don’t just design "pretty things" in Photoshop, Figma, or Blender; I design trilingual, resilient solutions that work in the real world.
              <br><br>
              So, shall we work together?
