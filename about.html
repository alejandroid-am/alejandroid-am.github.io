          <strong>Am I the right person for your project?</strong>
          <br>
          Let’s find out.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          I don't have a standard background, and honestly? That is my biggest asset.
          <br><br>
          My design process is shaped by a life of constant reinvention. I learned <strong>resilience</strong> in Cuba, <strong>business strategy</strong> in Chile—where I co-founded <em>Somos Arte</em> and built a community of 10k+ people from scratch—and finally, <strong>adaptability</strong> in France, where I moved for love and mastered a third language.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Why does this matter to you?</strong>
          <br>
          Because I don't look at a project and just see colors and typography. Thanks to my entrepreneurial roots, I see business goals, constraints, and user needs. I understand that a design isn't finished when it looks pretty in Figma; it's finished when it works in the browser and converts for your business.
          <br><br>
          I bridge the gap between creative vision and technical reality. Whether it's coding a prototype in Tailwind, modeling in Blender, or defining a brand identity, I bring a "founder's mindset" to every pixel.
          <br><br>
          I’m not just looking for a task to complete; I’m looking for the next problem to solve.
